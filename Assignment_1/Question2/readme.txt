README - Print "Marvellous" Five Times Using a Function and For Loop

Objective:
-----------
To create a program that prints the word "Marvellous" exactly five times on the screen by using a function named Display and a for loop.

Instructions:
--------------
1. Define a function named Display.
   - A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task when called.

2. Inside the Display function:
   - Use a for loop to control the repetition.
   - A for loop is a control structure that repeats a block of code a fixed number of times.
   - Set the loop to run five times.

3. In each iteration of the loop:
   - Print the word "Marvellous".

4. After defining the function:
   - Call the Display function to execute the task.

Notes:
-------
- Make sure the loop runs exactly five times.
- The word "Marvellous" should be printed once per loop iteration.
- The output should appear line by line on the screen.

Expected Output:
-----------------
Marvellous
Marvellous
Marvellous
Marvellous
Marvellous
