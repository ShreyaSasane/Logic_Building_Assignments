README - Print Numbers from 5 to 1 Using Function 'display' and a While Loop

Objective:
-----------
To create a program that prints numbers from 5 down to 1 in reverse order using a function named 'display' and a while loop.

Description:
-------------
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the use of a function and a while loop to perform a countdown from 5 to 1. 
The logic is enclosed within a function named 'display', which when called, executes the countdown and shows the output.

Instructions:
--------------
1. Define a function named display.
   - A function is a reusable block of logic that performs a specific task when called.

2. Inside the display function:
   - Initialize a variable with the starting number, which is 5.

3. Use a while loop to handle the repetition:
   - The loop should continue running as long as the number is greater than or equal to 1.
   - Inside the loop:
     a. Print the current value.
     b. Decrease the value by 1 in each iteration.

4. After defining the function:
   - Call the display function to run the countdown.

Key Points:
------------
- The loop should execute exactly five times.
- The loop must stop once the value becomes less than 1.
- Make sure the decrement happens inside the loop to avoid an infinite loop.

Expected Output:
-----------------
5
4
3
2
1

Notes:
-------
- This approach uses a while loop for better control over the condition.
- This logic can be reused in other countdown scenarios by adjusting the starting number.
