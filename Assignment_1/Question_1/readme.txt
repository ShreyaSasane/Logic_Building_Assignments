README - Perform Division of Two Numbers Using Function 'divide'

Objective:
-----------
To create a program that performs the division of two numbers using a function named 'divide'.

Description:
-------------
The program defines a function called 'divide' which takes two inputs: a numerator and a denominator. 
It then performs division and displays the result.

Instructions:
--------------
1. Define a function named divide.
   - A function is a reusable section of code designed to perform a particular task.
   - The divide function should accept two inputs: the number to be divided (numerator) and the number to divide by (denominator).

2. Inside the divide function:
   - Perform the division operation (numerator divided by denominator).
   - Display or return the result of the division.

3. Before performing the division:
   - Check if the denominator is zero.
   - If the denominator is zero, display an appropriate message such as "Cannot divide by zero" to avoid errors.

4. Call the divide function:
   - Provide two sample numbers for division.
   - Observe the output.

Example Scenario:
------------------
- Input: numerator = 10, denominator = 2
- Output: 5

- Input: numerator = 8, denominator = 0
- Output: Cannot divide by zero

Expected Behavior:
-------------------
- The function correctly divides two numbers and displays the result.
- If the denominator is zero, it should handle the situation gracefully without crashing.
