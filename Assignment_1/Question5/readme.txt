README - Print '*' Pattern 5 Times Using Function 'Accept' and For Loop

Objective:
-----------
To create a program that prints a pattern of "*" five times using a function named 'Accept' and a for loop.

Description:
-------------
The program defines a function called 'Accept', which will handle printing a pattern of "*" five times in a row using a for loop. The loop will repeat five times to display the desired pattern.

Instructions:
--------------
1. Define a function named Accept:
   - The 'Accept' function is responsible for generating the pattern.
   - It should use a for loop to print "*" five times.

2. Inside the Accept function:
   - The loop will run exactly five times.
   - In each iteration of the loop, print the "*" character.

3. After defining the function:
   - Call the Accept function to execute the task.
   - The output will be a single line of "*" printed five times.

Key Points:
------------
- The loop should execute exactly five times to print "*" five times.
- Ensure that there are no additional characters or spaces between the "*" symbols, unless intended.
- This pattern can be modified easily to print more or fewer "*" symbols by adjusting the loop count.

Expected Output:
-----------------
