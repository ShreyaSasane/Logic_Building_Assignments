Vowel Checker Program
=====================

Description:
This program accepts a single character input from the user and checks whether the character is a
vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or not. It is case-insensitive, meaning it will recognize both uppercase and lowercase vowels.

How to Use:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download the vowel_checker.py file from the repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the vowel_checker.py file is located.
5. Run the program by typing the following command:
   python vowel_checker.py
6. When prompted, enter a single character and press Enter.
7. The program will display whether the character is a vowel or not.

Input Requirements:
- The input must be a single character.
- The character can be either uppercase (A, E, I, O, U) or lowercase (a, e, i, o, u).
- If the input is not a single character, the program will prompt you to enter a valid character.

Example:
Input: a
Output: 'a' is a vowel.

Input: B
Output: 'B' is not a vowel.

Input: 1
Output: '1' is not a vowel.
