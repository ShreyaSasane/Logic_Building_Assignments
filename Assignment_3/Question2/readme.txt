Program: Print Even Factors of a Number

Description:
This program accepts one number from the user and prints all the even factors of that number. 
An even factor is a factor of the number that is also an even number. This demonstrates basic input handling,
 factorization, and conditional logic.

How It Works:
1. The program prompts the user to enter a number (N).
2. It calculates all the factors of N.
3. It then prints only those factors which are even numbers.

Example:

Input:
Enter a number: 24

Output:
2
4
6
8
12
24

Instructions:

- Input a positive integer when prompted.
- The program will find and print all even factors of the input number.
- If the number has no even factors (for example, if it is an odd number), no output (or a message) will 
be shown depending on implementation.

Notes:
- Factors are numbers that divide the given number without leaving a remainder.
- Even factors are those factors that are divisible by 2.
- The behavior on invalid input depends on the program implementation.

This description is language-agnostic and can be implemented in any programming language or environment 
that supports user input and printing output.
