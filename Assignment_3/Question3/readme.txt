Program: Convert Case of a Character

Description:
This program accepts a single character input from the user and converts its case. 
If the character is in uppercase, it will be converted to lowercase, and if it is in lowercase, it will be converted to uppercase.
 This demonstrates basic input handling and character manipulation.

How It Works:
1. The program prompts the user to enter a single character.
2. It checks the case of the character.
3. It then converts the character to the opposite case and displays the result.

Example:

Input:
Enter a character: a

Output:
A

Input:
Enter a character: B

Output:
b

Instructions:

- Input a single alphabetic character when prompted.
- The program will convert the case of the input character and display the result.
- If the input is not a single character, the program may display an error message or handle it based on implementation.

Notes:
- The program only processes alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z).
- Non-alphabetic characters (numbers, symbols) may be handled based on the implementation.
- The behavior on invalid input depends on the program implementation.

This description is language-agnostic and can be implemented in any programming language or environment
 that supports user input and character manipulation.
